# Linear Regression

This repository contains code and examples for implementing and understanding linear regression. Linear regression is a widely used statistical technique for modeling relationships between variables. This repository provides a detailed introduction to linear regression, including its assumptions, implementation in Python using scikit-learn, and examples using real-world datasets.

## Contents
The repository contains the following files:

linear_regression_implementation.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that provides an introduction to linear regression, including its assumptions, implementation in Python using scikit-learn, and examples using real-world datasets.

data: A directory containing example datasets used in the Jupyter notebook.

README.md: This file.


## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the Jupyter notebook:

Python 3.x
NumPy
