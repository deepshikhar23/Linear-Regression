# Linear Regression

This repository contains code and examples for implementing and understanding linear regression. Linear regression is a widely used statistical technique for modeling relationships between variables. This repository provides a detailed introduction to linear regression, including its assumptions, implementation in Python using scikit-learn, and examples using real-world datasets.

## Contents
The repository contains the following files:

linear_regression_implementation.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that provides an introduction to linear regression, including its assumptions, implementation in Python using scikit-learn, and examples using real-world datasets.

placement.csv: A simple dataset of shape (200,2) having two columns- cgpa(feature) and package(target).

README.md: This file.


## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the Jupyter notebook:

Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn


## Usage
To run the Jupyter notebook, navigate to the root directory of the repository and run the following command:

jupyter notebook linear_regression_implementation.ipynb

The notebook will open in your default web browser. You can then run the cells in the notebook to explore linear regression and the example datasets.
